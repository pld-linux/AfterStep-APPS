In %prep:

+ remove as-apps-compile.patch and add new one
  (as-apps-ascd-ascd_configure_and_install_bugfix.patch), which can
  be used instead of the old one.

+ remove ascp-paths.patch and aterm-utmp.patch.
  I don't now why and how they should be used?

+ add new as-apps-ascd-ascd_configure_and_install_bugfix.patch patch
  which fix few problems with configuration, compilation
  and instalation ascd

+ add new as-apps-miniCHESS-change_install_dirs.patch

In %build and %install I have changed few things to build
and install AfterStep-APPS property.
